== Operator: OpenShift Web Terminal
Now we need to install the *Web Terminal*, it is a web-based terminal for OpenShift. It allows users to access a terminal in a pod from the OpenShift Web Console.

== OpenShift Operators

This OpenShift cluster has been pre-configured with some operators and that may include the Web Terminal operator, 
but we can confirm this. 

Firstly, navigate to the *Administrator* perspective, and click on *Operators* from within the left-hand menu. 
Now, click on *Installed Operators* from the sub-menu.

Here, we can view the operators that have been installed to our cluster, as well as various details about their installation, etc.

If the *Web Terminal* is not present, now click on the *Operator Hub* choice in the side menu.

Use the search box to the find the *Web Terminal* operator. Make sure you choose the *Red Hat* variant.

[#open-web-terminal]
== OpenShift Web Terminal

OpenShift conveniently provides access to a web-based terminal that includes many of the
necessary command-line tools you need to interact with. You can open the web
terminal by clicking its launcher button on the upper right menu, near your
username. If you can't see this prompt, refresh the browser to update it after the installation:

Once the terminal is launched, you'll see it at the bottom of your screen:

You probably want to pop-out the terminal into a new browser window/tab so that
you can see the OpenShift console with your full screen. There's a pop-out
button on the right side:

Now that the web teminal is running, you will want to copy all the shell commands
into this window to complete the labs. When you see a yellow box that indicates
somethign to copy. You can click on the *copy* button (top right) to put the text
into your paste buffer and then paste into the web terminal.

One really important command to start with is to set the timeout of the Web terminal
much longer so it doesn't timeout during your workshop!

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
----
wtoctl set timeout 240m
----


[TIP]
====
In order to copy and paste content into the terminal, you can use
the secondary (typically right click) menus to do so. You can also
use the keyboard to paste content with the shortcut &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;shift&gt;&lt;v&gt;.
====

== Git Clone the Support Files 

This lab requires some support files and scripts to make life a little easier. Inside the web terminal console 
perform the following *git clone* to get some yaml files and shell scripts.

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
----
git clone https://github.com/alexgroom/madopssupport.git
----

[WARNING]
====
If the web terminal times out and close you will need to repeat this *git clone* command to
access the support file once again.
====

*Now we are all set to start the labs.*
